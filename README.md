**This project aims to develop an interactive and engaging quiz application using JavaScript.**

The quiz app will feature:

* **Question bank:** A collection of questions with various difficulty levels and categories.
* **Timer:** A countdown timer to encourage quick thinking and time management.
* **Scoring system:** A system to track and display the user's score.
* **Feedback:** Providing feedback on correct and incorrect answers.

Key functionalities will include:

* **Multiple-choice questions:** The primary question format will be multiple-choice.
* **Randomization:** Questions will be presented in a random order.
* **Progress bar:** A visual indicator of the user's progress through the quiz.
* **Result screen:** A summary of the user's performance, including total score and correct/incorrect answers.

By building this quiz app, I will demonstrate my understanding of JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and conditional logic.
